terraform init
terraform plan -out storageaccount.tfplan

terraform output storage_account_access_key

terraform output -raw backend_config | tee remote_backend.hcl


export ARM_ACCESS_KEY={storage_account_access_key}


Step 2


copy  remote_backend.hcl from step1 to step2

Copy the contents of file remote_backend.hcl to file provider.tf within terraform {} block
